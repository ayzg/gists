# [Note] How do I create a Gist with a title ?
1. Create a gist with a single "description" file `!<gist-title>.md`. The title file is chosen based on the alphabetically first file. You can prefix the file with a character such as `!`(ASCII == 33), to always make this file first.
   The title of this file will be your gist title.
   Up to 1024 characters in this file will show up in the gist browser. The rest will be cut off.  
2. You can change the name or add the file, after already adding the sources. As long the name is alpahabetically first.
