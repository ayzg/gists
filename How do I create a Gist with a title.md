# How do I create a Gist with a title ?
1. Create a gist with a single "desription" file `<gist-title>.md`. 
   The title of this file will be your gist title.
   Up to 1024 characters in this file will show up in the gist browser. The rest will be cut off.  
3. After creating the gist, add your source file as a new file. 
   Then, you can control the title and description by editing the first commited .md file.
3. **optional** Add a `README.md` file, which will always show up at the top of the gist page.
